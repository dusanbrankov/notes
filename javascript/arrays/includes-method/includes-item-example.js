// The array .includes(item) method is one of the simplest array methods as it takes an item rather than a callback and returns true when that item exists in the array and false otherwise. Here's an example:

const groceries = ["Apple", "Peach", "Tomato"];

groceries.includes("Tomato"); // true
groceries.includes("Bread"); // false
