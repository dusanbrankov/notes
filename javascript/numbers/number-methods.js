// While there are some other methods you could call on numbers, they are not very commonly used. What is commonly used, however, is the Math object which contains methods such as min(), max(), round(), etc.

// Here are some examples:

Math.round(2.6); // 3
Math.floor(2.6); // 2
Math.ceil(2.6); // 3

Math.round(2.5); // 3
Math.floor(2.5); // 2
Math.ceil(2.5); // 3
