Semantic section elements:

- main
- section
  - major section of a page
- article
  - for repeated content which can be used on their own
- aside
  - related to main content, but not necessary to understand it
- nav
- footer


Fill in accessibility tree with ARIA:

<section aria-labelledby="title-name">
    <h2 id="title-name">Title name</h2>
    ...
</section>


Primary navigation:

Menu button should also be in the nav because it needs to be interacted with to show the options.

<header>
    <a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>
    <nav aria-label="main">
    <button aria-controls="menu-items">Menu</button>
    <ul id="menu-items">
        <li><a href="#main" aria-current="page">Home</a></li>
        ...
    </ul>
</header>


Unordered lists:

Screen readers will tell the user how many items are in the list as soon as they enter them.


The role of elements:

<div aria-label="Lemon">Some text</div>
<span aria-label="Strawberry">Some text</span>
<button aria-label="Apple">Some text</button>

<div> and <span> don't have a role

<button> has a role

Screen readers use roles to determine what content to read out

NVDA reads aria-label for <button> but element content for <div> and <span>
